# Chess

##Description
Ruby implemented Chess game. Allows two players to play on a terminal screen with terminal inputted moves.

##Features
* Uses Slideable and Steppable classes to maintain DRY code.
* Uses an EnPassantTracer object on the chessboard to provide an OO solution to en passant.
* Performs deep duping on the Board object in order to assess the validity of player moves.

##Startup
* Download repo
* In console, type 'ruby chess_game.rb'

## TODOs
* Add in draw conditions (stalemate, lack of pieces, 3 move rep, 50 move no-capture)
* Computer Player implementation.
